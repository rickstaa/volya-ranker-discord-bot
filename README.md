# volya-ranker-discord-bot

A small discord bot that I created as a community member of the VOLYA NFT project. This bot can be used to get the rank and tier of a VOLYA NFT. The bot currently adds rank and rarity tier info to Magic Eden listings and sales and can return these ranks and tiers using the `/rank` command.

## How to use

1.  Install the python dependencies using `pip install .`.
2.  Set the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environmental variable.
3.  Run the bot using the `python bot.py` command.
